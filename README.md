# üïäÔ∏è Aerial Object Classification & Detection

## üìò Overview
This project focuses on building a **Deep Learning-based system** capable of classifying aerial images into **Bird** or **Drone**, and optionally performing **Object Detection** using **YOLOv8**.  
It supports applications in **Aerial Surveillance**, **Wildlife Monitoring**, and **Security & Defense** sectors where accurate distinction between drones and birds is crucial.

## üß© Problem Statement
The goal is to build an AI-based solution that can:
- **Classify** aerial images into *Bird* or *Drone*.  
- **Detect & localize** these objects in real-world aerial footage (optional YOLOv8 extension).  

This aids in:
- Airspace safety (detect unauthorized drones).  
- Wildlife protection (avoid bird strikes).  
- Automated aerial monitoring and environmental research.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset Understanding
- Explore folder structure.  
- Count images per class.  
- Identify class imbalance.  
- Visualize sample images.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
- Normalize pixel values to `[0, 1]`.  
- Resize all images to a fixed dimension (e.g., 224√ó224).  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Augmentation
- Apply transformations: rotation, flipping, zoom, brightness variation, cropping.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Building (Classification)
- **Custom CNN:** Convolutional, pooling, dropout, batch normalization, and dense layers.  
- **Transfer Learning:** Fine-tune pre-trained models like *ResNet50*, *MobileNet*, *EfficientNetB0*.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training
- Use **EarlyStopping** and **ModelCheckpoint**.  
- Track **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-Score**.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation
- Evaluate on test data using a **confusion matrix** and **classification report**.  
- Visualize **accuracy** and **loss curves**.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Model Comparison
- Compare results of custom CNN vs transfer learning models.  
- Select the best-performing model for deployment.

## üßæ Optional Module: Object Detection (YOLOv8)

### Steps:
1. Install YOLOv8 (`pip install ultralytics`)  
2. Prepare dataset (images + YOLOv8-format `.txt` label files).  
3. Create `data.yaml` configuration file.  
4. Train YOLOv8 model using the command:  
   ```bash
   yolo train model=yolov8n.pt data=data.yaml epochs=50 imgsz=640
